NAME
    Algorithm::Diff::Callback - Use callbacks on computed differences

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    One of the difficulties when using diff modules is that they assume they
    know what you want the information for. Some give you formatted output,
    some give you just the values that changes (but neglect to mention how
    each changed) and some (such as Algorithm::Diff) give you way too much
    information that you now have to skim and write long complex loops for.

    Algorithm::Diff::Callback let's you pick what you're going to diff
    (Array, Hashes) and set callbacks for the diff process.

        use Algorithm::Diff::Callback 'diff_arrays';

        diff_arrays(
            \@old_family_members,
            \@new_family_members,
            sub { print "Happy to hear about ", shift },
            sub { print "Sorry to hear about ", shift },
        );
